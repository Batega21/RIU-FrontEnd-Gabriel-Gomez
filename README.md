This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Requirements

- Angular 19
- Node.js >= 20.x
- The Justice League microservice.
  - Download the micro-server repository [here](https://github.com/Batega21/justice-league-microservice).
  - Read the `README.md` file for installation and run the microservice.

## Description

The Justice League application uses **Angular 19** for its structure and components, **Angular Material** for a cohesive UI, and **NgRx** for predictable state management using the **SignalStore**, ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

## Application Structure

The application employs a modular structure, organizing code into distinct, manageable units. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and overall code organization.
